. Sales Trends Were Unclear
What I found: When I checked the total and monthly sales data, I noticed big ups and downs in revenue, but there was no record of why this was happening.

Why it’s a problem: Without knowing the pattern, the store can’t prepare for slow months or take advantage of high-demand periods.

Solution: Keep a monthly sales dashboard to track growth, compare with past data, and plan promotions for low-sales months.

2. Stock Was Not Matching Customer Demand
What I found: Some products were selling a lot, while others barely moved off the shelves. But the store kept ordering all products in similar quantities.

Why it’s a problem: This causes overstocking of slow sellers (wasting space and money) and sometimes shortages of popular items.

Solution: Increase stock for high-demand items and put discounts on slow sellers or remove them from inventory.

3. No Clear View of Category Performance
What I found: Sales weren’t being grouped by product category, so the store didn’t know which categories made the most money. My analysis showed that some categories (like Beverages & Snacks) brought in a big share of revenue.

Why it’s a problem: Without this insight, marketing and stock planning can be inefficient.

Solution: Focus ads and offers on strong categories and create strategies to improve weaker ones.

4. Customers Were Not Segmented
What I found: A small group of customers (top 5%) was spending much more than others, but they were treated the same as casual shoppers.

Why it’s a problem: Treating all customers the same means missing chances for loyalty and repeat purchases.

Solution: Offer special rewards, loyalty points, and exclusive deals to high-value customers, and personalized offers to frequent buyers.

5. Seasonal Demand Was Being Missed
What I found: Certain products sold more during specific months, but no seasonal promotions were being done.

Why it’s a problem: The store was not taking advantage of seasonal peaks to boost revenue.

Solution: Stock up and run campaigns during peak seasons (like soft drinks in summer, chocolates during festivals).

6. Payment Method Preferences Were Unknown
What I found: Digital wallets were becoming more popular, and cash usage was falling, but the store wasn’t focusing on this.

Why it’s a problem: Checkout speed and customer convenience could be improved if the preferred payment methods were prioritized.

Solution: Promote digital wallet payments and give incentives for using faster payment options.

7. Products Bought Together Were Not Promoted
What I found: Certain items were often bought together (like Bread & Butter, Chips & Soda), but the store wasn’t promoting them as bundles.

Why it’s a problem: Missed opportunities to increase basket size and sales.

Solution: Place these products close together and offer bundle discounts or combo packs.
